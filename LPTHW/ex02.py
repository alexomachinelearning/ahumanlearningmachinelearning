# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")

print "I could have code like this."
print "This will run."

# Exercise from "Exercise 2" in Learn Python the Hard Way.
# I learned the purpose of the octothorpe.
# I observed that print "message" and print("message") both lead to the same outcome when running python.
# It's an interesting juxtaposition that an octophorpe is used in code to hide something yet is used for hashtags on social media platforms to find and show something to a wider audience.
