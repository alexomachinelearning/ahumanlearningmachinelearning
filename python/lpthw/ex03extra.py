# The code below prints a series of questions and answers as I practiced printing basic text, basic math, and float() for the first time.

print "Q: Is this thing on?"
print "A: Yes it is!"
print "Awesome! What's 2 + 3?", 2 + 3
print "Nice! Now let's use our decimals. What is 2.0 + 3.0?", 2.0 + 3.0
print "Excellent. Last but not least, let's try that with floating point numbers, another term for decimal numbers. What is 2.0 + 3.0?", float(2) + float(3)
print "Good work, human!"
